I am a Ph.D candidate in Digital Humanities and English Literature at the University of Chicago. I use computational methods to study the history of American literature and the book market.

I'm also a research associate at the University of Chicago's [Textual Optics Lab](https://textual-optics-lab.uchicago.edu/), a humanities lab dedicated to the computational analysis of historical texts. 

This site hosts my personal [blog](https://jordanpruett.github.io/) and a portfolio of recent [projects](https://jordanpruett.github.io/projects/).
