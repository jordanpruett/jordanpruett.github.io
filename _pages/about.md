I am a Ph.D candidate in Digital Humanities and English Literature at the University of Chicago. My research involves using methods from data science and machine learning to study the history of American literature and the book market.

I'm also a Research Assistant at the University of Chicago's [Textual Optics Lab](https://textual-optics-lab.uchicago.edu/), a humanities lab dedicated to the computational analysis of cultural and historical texts. 

This site hosts my CV, teaching history, current projects, and personal blog.
